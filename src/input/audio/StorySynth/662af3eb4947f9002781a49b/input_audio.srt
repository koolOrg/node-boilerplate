1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
In a dark and hidden part of Colombia, there was a man whose actions were so terrible that

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,040
they are hard to believe.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,560
His name was Luis Alfredo Garavito Cubillos, but he was better known as La Bestia or The

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,760
Beast.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,600
His life was marked by a series of horrifying crimes, some of the worst in recent history.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,640
Born on January 25, 1957, into a family where he faced a lot of abuse and neglect, Garavito's

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,080
early years were filled with suffering, which he later inflicted on others.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,420
Growing up in Ceylan, Garavito had a very hard childhood.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,920
His father was abusive, and at school he was constantly teased and called Garabato because

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,720
he wore glasses.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,440
He felt alienated and alone, and this isolation was made worse by a terrible incident of abuse

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,720
by a local pharmacist.

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,720
These experiences filled him with deep anger and a desire for revenge against a world that

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,880
had treated him so harshly.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,480
The 1980s were the beginning of his dreadful crimes.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,360
He targeted Colombia's most vulnerable children, those who were poor, orphaned, or homeless.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,320
He would first gain their trust by offering them small jobs or gifts, then he would take

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,280
them to hidden places where he committed shocking acts of cruelty.

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,280
He would tie them up, hurt them, and kill them with such brutality that it caused nationwide

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
horror.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Garavito found perverse pleasure in these acts and meticulously recorded them as if

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
keeping a journal of pain and death.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,960
For nearly two decades, Garavito moved from one city to another, changing his appearance

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,800
and taking on different roles, from priests to teachers, to avoid capture.

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,320
The Colombian police, already struggling with other national problems, found it difficult

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,720
to connect the cases of missing children to him, even as the number of cases grew.

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,560
It wasn't until 1999, after he tried to attack a boy named John Ivan Sabagal, that

28
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,040
the police began to piece together the evidence that would lead to his capture.

29
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,600
This marked the beginning of the end of his reign of terror.

30
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,800
When arrested, Garavito confessed to the murder of 147 children.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,880
His trial resulted in the longest sentence in Colombian history, 1,853 years in prison.

32
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,360
However, due to legal limits he could only serve a maximum of 40 years.

33
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,320
His case shocked both the nation and the world, generating a massive outcry over how such

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,640
evil could have gone unnoticed for so long.

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,880
Garavito died of cancer in prison in October 2023.

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,640
His death brought little solace to the Colombian people, who still live with the painful memories

37
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,240
of his crimes.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,400
The story of his life is a chilling reminder of the darkness that can exist within the

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
human heart.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,120
His tale ends with a warning to everyone.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,840
Stay safe, stay vigilant.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,780
This message highlights that evil is relentless, and once innocence is lost, it can never

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,880
be fully regained.

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,680
This narrative serves not only as a recount of his crimes, but also as a call to maintain

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,840
vigilance and protect the vulnerable in society.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,800
It reminds us that the cost of overlooking such evil is too great, a lesson that remains

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,400
relevant beyond the borders of Colombia, and continues to resonate globally.
